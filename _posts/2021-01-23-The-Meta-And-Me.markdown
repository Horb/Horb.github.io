# Dota2: The Meta and Me

Many of my friends have recently bought their first PCs for gaming and despite
my warnings ... we're all playing Dota2. I haven't played for a while so when I 
stepped back into ranked I didn't know where the meta was. What heroes should I 
pick?

I enjoyed this [recent post][hero_grids] by [/u/Anomalina89][user] and want to
produce a hero grid that shows;

- the heroes I can play well
- the heroes that are performing well int he meta

I can gather both of these from Dotabuff. If your Dotabuff is properly configured 
then you can find the heroes you play well [here][winning]. Ignoring heroes I have
less than 5 games for I can group heroes into Good, Bad and Unknown whereby;

- I have a >=50% win rate in 5 or more games for Good heroes
- I have a <50% win rate in 5 or more games for Bad heroes;
- Everything else is categorised as Unknown.

For the Meta we can categorise heroes as;

- Meta if they have a >=52.5% win rate
- Off if they have a <=47.5% win rate
- leaving the rest uncategorised.

Which leaves me with the following categorisations;

| Off Good | Good | Meta Good |
| Off Unknown | Unknown | Meta Unknown |
| Off Bad | Bad | Meta Bad |

The winners (Meta Good) for me are Abaddon, Bounty Hunter, Dark Seer, Razor and Tidehunter. The loser (Off Bad) for me is Shadow Demon which makes me sad because I love shadow Demon. Here's my full hero grid;

In games this helps me because;

- I can look down the right hand side for something to ban,
- I can look at anything on the top / right edge for a good / meta pick,
- I know to avoid anything on the left / bottom,
- If needs must I can resort to some unknown in the middle.

Check back soon because I hope to produce a tool that can quickly generate these
hero grids.
